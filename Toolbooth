Imagine a tollbooth with a class called TollBooth. The two data items are of type unsigned int and double to hold the total number of cars and totalamount of money collected. A constructor initializes both of these data 
members to 0. A member function called payingCar( )increments the car total and adds 0.5 to the cash total. Another function called nonPayCar( ) increments the car total but adds nothing to the cash total. Finally a member function called display( )shows the two totals. Include a program to test this 
class. This program should allow the user to push one key to count a paying car and another to count a non paying car. Pushing the ESC key should cause the program to print out the total number of cars and total cash and
then exit.
#include <iostream>
#include <conio.h> 
using namespace std;

class TollBooth {
private:
    unsigned int totalCars;  
    double totalCash;       

public:
    TollBooth(){
        totalCars = totalCash = 0;
    }

    void payingCar() {
        totalCars++;
        totalCash += 0.5;
    }

    void nonPayCar() {
        totalCars++;
    }

    void display() const {
        cout << "\nTotal number of cars: " << totalCars << endl;
        cout << "Total cash collected: " << totalCash << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    TollBooth tollbooth;
    char key;

    cout << "Toll Booth \n";
    cout << "Press 'p' for paying car,\n'n' for non-paying car, and \n'ESC' to exit and display totals.\n";

    while (true) {
        key = _getch();
        if (key == 27) { 
            tollbooth.display();  
            break;
        } else if (key == 'p' || key == 'P') {
            tollbooth.payingCar();  
            cout << "Paying car processed.\n";
        } else if (key == 'n' || key == 'N') {
            tollbooth.nonPayCar();  
            cout << "Non-paying car processed.\n";
        } else {
            cout << "Invalid key. Please press 'p', 'n', or ESC.\n";
        }
