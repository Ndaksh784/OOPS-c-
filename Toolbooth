Imagine a tollbooth with a class called TollBooth. The two data items are of type unsigned int and double to hold the total number of cars and totalamount of money collected. A constructor initializes both of these data 
members to 0. A member function called payingCar( )increments the car total and adds 0.5 to the cash total. Another function called nonPayCar( ) increments the car total but adds nothing to the cash total. Finally a member function called display( )shows the two totals. Include a program to test this 
class. This program should allow the user to push one key to count a paying car and another to count a non paying car. Pushing the ESC key should cause the program to print out the total number of cars and total cash and
then exit.

#include <iostream>
#include <conio.h> 
using namespace std;

class TollBooth {
private:
    static int carCount;  
    static double cashTotal;       

public:
    
    TollBooth() {}

   
    void payingCar() {
        carCount++;
        cashTotal += 0.5;  
    }

    void nonPayCar() {
        carCount++;  
    }

   
    static void display() {  
        cout << "Total number of cars: " << carCount << endl;
        cout << "Total cash collected: $" << cashTotal << endl;
    }
};


int TollBooth::carCount = 0; 
double TollBooth::cashTotal = 0.0;    
int main() {
    TollBooth tollbooth; 
    char choice;

    cout << "Press 'P' for a paying car, 'N' for a non-paying car, or 'ESC' to exit." << endl;

    while (true) {
        cout<<"Enter choice"<<endl;
        choice = _getch();  

        if (choice == 27) { 
            TollBooth::display();  
            break; 
        } else if (choice == 'P' || choice == 'p') {
            tollbooth.payingCar(); 
        } else if (choice == 'N' || choice == 'n') {
            tollbooth.nonPayCar();   
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
